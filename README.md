## üìñ About This Project

This project is a straightforward yet functional Task Manager (or To-Do List) application. It allows users to add new tasks, mark them as complete, and remove them from the list. The key feature of this application is its use of the browser's **local storage**, which means your tasks will be saved and will persist even after you close the browser tab or refresh the page.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks through a simple input field.
-   **Mark as Complete:** Toggle a task's completion status, which visually strikes it through.
-   **Remove Tasks:** Delete tasks you no longer need.
-   **Persistent Storage:** All tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so your list is always waiting for you when you return.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the application.
-   **CSS3:** For styling the application for a clean and user-friendly interface.
-   **JavaScript (ES6):** For all the application logic, including DOM manipulation and interacting with local storage.

## üöÄ How It Works

The application's logic is handled by a single JavaScript file (`script.js`).
-   When the page loads, the script first checks for any existing tasks saved in **local storage**.
-   Tasks are stored as an array of objects in local storage, with each object containing the task's name and its completion status.
-   The `renderTasks()` function dynamically creates the list on the page based on the current tasks array.
-   Event listeners on the "Add," "Complete," and "Remove" buttons trigger functions that modify the tasks array, save the updated array back to local storage, and then re-render the list to reflect the changes.
